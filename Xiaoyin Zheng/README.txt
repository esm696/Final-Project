To run the code:

1.The data named '696_100balls_noverlap_12_6.tiff' has been uploaded on blackboard. Download it and put in the same folder with PSD.py

2. run PSD.py

The code 'data_cropping.ipynd' is used to crop the data and 'generate_balls.py' is used to generate the data '696_100balls_noverlap_12_6.tiff'. The data is generated randomly so it is not repeatable.
