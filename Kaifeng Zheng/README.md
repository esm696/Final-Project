# project discription
This project aim is to implement molecular dynamics to simulate Inert Gas Condensation(IGC) process to generate Cu<sub>64</sub>Zr<sub>36</sub> nanoparticles in Ar environment. Pressure in this process determines the speed of cool-down process, so it will influence the shape and structure of the result particles. In this application, I used 4 bar, 6 bar, and 10 bar to generate three different particles. If you would like to learn more, please see [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.115451).<br>
Here I used Python to analyze the data. There are two discussions in this project file.
1. investigate the density distribution and Cu segregation.
2. Compare Voronoi Statistics for 3 IGC particles and one melting-quenching bulk material.
