# Cu segregation
The aim for this work is to find Cu segregation of the IGC particles. There is three steps:
1. build relationship between local density and atom to surface distance for the spherical particles(i.e 4 bar and 6 bar particles).
2. build relationship between local density and Cu percentage for all particles
3  build relationship between atom to surface and Cu percentage for all particles. (The relationship of local density is proportional to atom to surface distance, so we can use a linear relationship to transfer from local density to atom to surface distance)
