This program will:

Count how many atoms have the same gid (which will give me the size)
Find the average (the average number of atoms in a grain) and std deviation
Find avg size (the diameter of the grain) is calculated from surface area of the grain
Take number of grains in the avg grain, divide by the thickness (4) then calculate the diameter (d)from A=Ï€(d/2)^2 [each atom has a fixed area/volume]
Add this data to a set of avg grain sizes whose x axis is temperature and y axis is concentration
Calculate grain boundary fraction (sum of ones in gbid column), add to grain boundary fraction set (fgb) [same x & y axis]
Calculate t (the normalized grain boundary thickness) using fgb =1-((t-d)/d)^D -> D is shape factor, use 2 & also 3 to compare
Repeat the above - for each temperature and each at. %
Display the values of t as a contour map - x axis being temperature, y axis being concentration.
It will also calculate a normalized version of the grain boundary perimeter as an effective length scale.

In order to do this, it needs data generated by my lattice monte carlo algorithm, which is structured as a LAMMPS file.
My algorithm names the final step of the monte carlo run "step100000.txt" - although this can be changed as well.
These files need to be in a directory structure that has the pattern ../$temperature/$atomic percent

This may be altered using the list of directories subroutine.

For the purposes of the work I have tested this on, the temperatures ranged from 50 to 900 degrees C.
For each temperature, the at. % solute ranged from 1 to 30.
