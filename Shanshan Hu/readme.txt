Intructions:

Step1: run the code

Step2: "Please input the burgers vector for TED" pop out. You should enter "0" or "ax". (0 means the dislocation don't have TED component, ax means the value of TED is ax.)

Step3: "Please input the burgers vector for TSD" pop out. You should enter "0" or "cx" or "-cx". (0 means the dislocation don't have TSD component, cx means the value of TSD is cx and direction is along [0001], -cx means the value of TSD is cx and the direction is opposite to [0001]).

Step4: This step is to set the direction of TED component. So this step will not occur if you choose 0 in step2. This step only occurs when you choose "ax" in step2. You should enter the angle between the TED component and [11-20] direction. In this step, you can enter "0", "60", "120","180","240",or "300".

The result can be get after step4. The total time to get a result is about 20mins.

One thing you need to be careful is that you cannot both choose 0 in step2 and step3. Because you must have a value for the dislocation.
